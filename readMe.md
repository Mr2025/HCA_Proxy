#Welcome to HCA-Proxy#
Hca is a [home control assistant] (https://www.homecontrolassistant.com/)
Older versions can be found [here] (https://www.hcatech.com/)

This product is extreamly competitive in the home automation marketspace.
and has a visual programing language for many home related triggers. 

As an enthusist in this field; I wanted to create my own devices and protocols, and intergrate external systems into the product. 

So I build an interface using some of the interal funcitons of the system. 

Please enjoy!!
